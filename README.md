# build phar

    php src/Compiler.php

# htaccess code to show webp instead of png/jpg when browser supports

Code adapted from [webp-express](https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-express)

    RewriteEngine On

    # redirect images to webp when possible
    # check if browser accepts webp
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} image/webp

    # check if requested file is jpg or png
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} \.(jpe?g|png)$

    # check if webp for image exists
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.webp -f

    # serve webp image instead
    RewriteRule . %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.webp [T=image/webp,E=EXISTING:1,E=ADDVARY:1,L]

    # make sure that browsers which do not support webp also get the Vary:Accept header
    # when requesting images that would be redirected to existing webp on browsers that does.
    SetEnvIf Request_URI "\.(jpe?g|png)$" ADDVARY

    # Apache appends "REDIRECT_" in front of the environment variables defined in mod_rewrite, but LiteSpeed does not.
    # So, the next lines are for Apache, in order to set environment variables without "REDIRECT_"
    SetEnvIf REDIRECT_EXISTING 1 EXISTING=1
    SetEnvIf REDIRECT_ADDVARY 1 ADDVARY=1

    # Set Vary:Accept header for the image types handled by WebP Express.
    # The purpose is to make proxies and CDNs aware that the response varies with the Accept header.
    Header append "Vary" "Accept" env=ADDVARY

# improvement ideas

- check that image does not have size 0 after generation
